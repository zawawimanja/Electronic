serial protocol
-  uses one or two transmission lines to send and receive data, and that data is continuously sent and received one bit at a time.

1. uart 
- tx and rx
- 2 wire above
-asynchronous protocol and using baud speed. 9600baud speed =9600bits per seconds
-baud speed,data length,start bit,stop bit,parity bit 
-most significant bits, 


2. i2c

-synchronous protocol
-sda-RX & TX,scl - clock
- 2wire above

3.spi 

-SCK (Serial Clock Line), MISO (Master Out Slave In)- TX, MOSI (Master In Slave Out)-RX, and SS/CS (Chip Select).
-4 wires above
- synchronous protocol using frequency
